# Defining-Smart-Contract-Defects-on-Ethereum

TSE-Defects-Definition defines 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating potential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability problems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we created an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different countries. We manually identified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and publicly released our dataset.
